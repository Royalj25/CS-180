# 👋 Hi, my name is Jaiah Royal!

Welcome to my coding portfolio!  
This repository contains projects I’ve completed for my Object-Oriented Programming course.
As I progress through the semester, I will upload new projects to showcase my hard work and learning.
I built this space to make it easier for you (employers, collaborators, or the just-curious) to explore my work.
