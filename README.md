# 👋 Hi, I’m Jaiah

Welcome to my coding portfolio!  
This repository is a collection of projects I’ve completed through my Object-Oriented Programming course.
As I progess through the semester, I will upload projects that I complete to showcase my hardwork in the class.
I built this space to make it easier for you (employers, collaborators, or the just-curious) to explore my work.
